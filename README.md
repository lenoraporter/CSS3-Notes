# CSS3-Notes

Book: [CSS3 for Web Designers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37781370-css3-for-web-designers?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=pn32sNkpHC&rank=1)

Before diving too deep into this book, I had to keep in mind that this book was published in 2015 (The Second Edition)

What have a learned so far?

June 2011, CSS3 was introduced to modern web browsers. According to the book, CSS3 is a series of modules that are designed to be implemented separately and independently from each other. This segmented approach has enabled portions of the spec to move faster for others and has encouraged browser vendors to implement the pieces that are further along before the entirety of CSS3 is considered finished. 

CSS3 targets the experience layer. Previously, CSS focused on the critical aspects of UI (Layout, type, color, etc.) while CSS3 is introducing the experience layer to the game (animations, feedback, movement -- previously left to technologies like Flash and JavaScript)

|   Critical    |  Non-Critical  |
|:--------------|:---------------|
|    Branding   |   Interaction  |
|   Usability   | Visual Rewards |
| Accessibility |    Feedback    |
|    Layout     |    Movement    |
